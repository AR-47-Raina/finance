If you want to calculate the future value of a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) over a duration of **6 months** instead of 50 weeks, we can break it down similarly.

### Given Parameters
1. **Monthly Investment (SIP)**: Rs. 5000
2. **Weekly Interest Rate**: 5% (0.05)
3. **Total Duration**: 6 months (approximately 24 weeks, assuming 4 weeks per month)

### Investment Schedule
You will invest Rs. 5000 every month for 6 months. Each investment will compound for a different number of weeks, which we will calculate.

### Monthly Investments and Compounding
- **First SIP**: Compounds for 24 weeks (first month)
- **Second SIP**: Compounds for 20 weeks (second month)
- **Third SIP**: Compounds for 16 weeks (third month)
- **Fourth SIP**: Compounds for 12 weeks (fourth month)
- **Fifth SIP**: Compounds for 8 weeks (fifth month)
- **Sixth SIP**: Compounds for 4 weeks (sixth month)

### Future Value Calculation
Using the formula for future value:

\[
FV = P \times (1 + r)^{n}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) = Rs. 5000 (monthly SIP)
- \( r \) = 0.05 (weekly interest rate)
- \( n \) = Number of weeks left for compounding.

### Future Value for Each SIP
1. **First SIP** (24 weeks):
   \[
   FV_1 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{24}
   \]

2. **Second SIP** (20 weeks):
   \[
   FV_2 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{20}
   \]

3. **Third SIP** (16 weeks):
   \[
   FV_3 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{16}
   \]

4. **Fourth SIP** (12 weeks):
   \[
   FV_4 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{12}
   \]

5. **Fifth SIP** (8 weeks):
   \[
   FV_5 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{8}
   \]

6. **Sixth SIP** (4 weeks):
   \[
   FV_6 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{4}
   \]

### Total Future Value Calculation
To find the total future value after 6 months, sum all the future values:

\[
\text{Total Future Value} = FV_1 + FV_2 + FV_3 + FV_4 + FV_5 + FV_6
\]

### Example Calculation
Let's calculate the future values for each SIP investment based on the above formulas:

1. **First SIP** (24 weeks):
   \[
   FV_1 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{24} \approx 5000 \times 3.207 = 16035
   \]

2. **Second SIP** (20 weeks):
   \[
   FV_2 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{20} \approx 5000 \times 2.653 = 13265
   \]

3. **Third SIP** (16 weeks):
   \[
   FV_3 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{16} \approx 5000 \times 2.267 = 11335
   \]

4. **Fourth SIP** (12 weeks):
   \[
   FV_4 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{12} \approx 5000 \times 1.892 = 9460
   \]

5. **Fifth SIP** (8 weeks):
   \[
   FV_5 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{8} \approx 5000 \times 1.477 = 7385
   \]

6. **Sixth SIP** (4 weeks):
   \[
   FV_6 = 5000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{4} \approx 5000 \times 1.215 = 6075
   \]

### Total Future Value
Now, add these future values together:

\[
\text{Total Future Value} = 16035 + 13265 + 11335 + 9460 + 7385 + 6075
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total Future Value} \approx 16035 + 13265 + 11335 + 9460 + 7385 + 6075 \approx  68655
\]

### Conclusion
The total future value of your SIP investments after 6 months, with the specified parameters, is approximately **Rs. 68,655**.
